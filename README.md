# README

Here are some projects that I've done at App Academy.

### Here's how to use the contents of this file.

0. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (if you haven't already)-- these games are written in Ruby.

1. Fork this repo and/or download a zip file and open it up.

2. Open the terminal.

3. In the terminal, navigate to "A_A_projects" (or whatever you named it).

  ```
  $ cd ~/Downloads/A_A_projects
  ```

4. Play a game.

  *You can exit any game by typing "quit".*


  To play Chess:

  ```
  $ ruby chess/chess_game.rb
  ```


  To play Minesweeper:
  ```
  $ ruby minesweeper/minesweeper.rb
  ```

  To play Hangman:
  ```
  $ ruby hangman/hangman.rb

Enjoy!
