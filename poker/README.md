To play console poker, open the console, navigate to the directory of this folder, and enter:

```
  $ ruby poker/lib/poker_game.rb
```

*Please note* this game will not split the pot if two players tie. In the (highly unlikely) event of a tie, the pot will go to the player that comes earlier in the betting order.
